## Set DLL for [chrome_plus](https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus)

A utility tool for DLL injection into Windows executables, based on Microsoft Detours.

### Usage

```
setdll [options] binary_files
```

Options:
* `/d:file.dll` : Inject specified DLL into target binaries
* `/r` : Remove extra DLLs from binaries
* `/t:file.exe` : Show PE file architecture information
* `/?` : Display help information

### Injection Script

* Extract all files from [setdll.7z](https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus/releases/latest) to the directory where the browser executable to be injected is located, and run `injectpe.bat`. Once the command line runs successfully, it will automatically delete the extra files.

* `injectpe.bat` provides a convenient wrapper for injection operations. The default target is Microsoft Edge browser. If you want to use it on other browsers, please input the name of the executable file you wish to inject.
